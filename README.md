### This is still an alpha version, expect bugs.

Hi there,

This is a simple Picross puzzle build with JQuery.
This is the first thing I've ever built and I do not have a background in programming, so it probably does not have the cleanest or most efficient code around. This was more of a test for myself.
I like picross puzzles and I wanted to try to learn some JQuery, so I decided to build this.

Before I made this I knew a bit of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JQuery. It took me about 5 days to come this far.
It's far from finished, the JQuery code needs cleaning, the SASS needs cleaning and is not nearly DRY enough. But I'm learning, and that's what counts :)

There might be bugs around, in fact, I'm pretty sure you'll find some. Just let me know, and I'll try to fix them. General tips are always welcome! If you see something that could be more efficient, or something that's simply wrong, don't be shy and just tell me.

IF I FORGOT TO MENTION SOMEONE IN THE CREDITS (OR IF I MENTIONED SOMEONE IN THE WRONG WAY) PLEASE LET ME KNOW!
